# Handling Imbalanced Datasets Using Sampling Techniques

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project explores different sampling techniques to handle class imbalance in the **Medical Appointment No Shows** dataset.

## ðŸ“‚ Files Included
- `dai-assignment-23115068-kris.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook with the implementation.
- `KaggleV2-May-2016.csv` - Dataset used for training.
- `results.csv` - Model performance comparison.
- `README.md` - Project documentation.

## ðŸš€ Sampling Techniques Used
- Random Oversampling
- Random Undersampling
- Tomek Links
- SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)
- Class Weighing

## ðŸ“Š Model Performance
The best technique was **Class Weights**, achieving the highest **F1 Score** and balanced **AUC**.
